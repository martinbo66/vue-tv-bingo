# Architectural Decisions Log

This document records significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Vue TV Bingo project.

## ADR 1: Vue 3 with Composition API

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to choose a frontend framework for the TV Bingo application.

**Decision**: Use Vue 3 with the Composition API as the primary framework.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better TypeScript support
- ✅ Improved code organization and reusability
- ✅ Better performance than Vue 2
- ✅ More modern development experience
- ❌ Learning curve for developers new to Composition API
- ❌ Some third-party libraries might not be fully compatible yet

## ADR 2: TypeScript Implementation

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to decide on type safety approach.

**Decision**: Implement TypeScript with strict mode enabled.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better type safety and error catching
- ✅ Improved IDE support and developer experience
- ✅ Better documentation through types
- ❌ Additional development overhead
- ❌ More complex build configuration

## ADR 3: State Management Approach

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to decide on state management strategy.

**Decision**: Use Vue's built-in reactivity system with composables instead of a global state management library.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simpler architecture
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Easier testing
- ✅ Reduced bundle size
- ❌ Need to carefully manage state organization
- ❌ May need to refactor if application grows significantly

## ADR 4: Build Tool Selection

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to choose a build tool for the project.

**Decision**: Use Vite as the build tool.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Faster development server
- ✅ Better hot module replacement
- ✅ Modern build features
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ❌ Some plugins might not be available yet
- ❌ Need to ensure production build optimization

## ADR 5: Testing Strategy

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to establish testing approach.

**Decision**: Implement a combination of unit tests with Vue Test Utils and end-to-end tests with Cypress.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Good developer experience
- ✅ Reliable testing infrastructure
- ❌ Additional development time
- ❌ More complex CI/CD pipeline

## ADR 6: Accessibility Implementation

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to ensure application accessibility.

**Decision**: Implement WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance with focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better accessibility
- ✅ Legal compliance
- ✅ Improved user experience
- ❌ Additional development time
- ❌ More complex component implementation

## ADR 7: Error Handling Strategy

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to establish error handling approach.

**Decision**: Implement a centralized error handling system with custom error types and error boundaries.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ❌ Additional complexity
- ❌ Need to maintain error types

## ADR 8: Performance Optimization

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to ensure optimal performance.

**Decision**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and performance monitoring.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ✅ Better user experience
- ❌ More complex build configuration
- ❌ Need to monitor performance metrics

## ADR 9: Documentation Strategy

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to establish documentation approach.

**Decision**: Create comprehensive documentation including memory bank, component documentation, and API documentation.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better knowledge sharing
- ✅ Easier onboarding
- ✅ Better maintainability
- ❌ Additional maintenance overhead
- ❌ Need to keep documentation up to date

## ADR 10: Deployment Strategy

**Date**: 2024-02-16
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to establish deployment approach.

**Decision**: Implement automated deployment with staging and production environments.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reliable deployment process
- ✅ Better quality control
- ✅ Easier rollback capability
- ❌ More complex infrastructure
- ❌ Additional maintenance overhead
